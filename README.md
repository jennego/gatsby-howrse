  Hobby Collection Site with Gatsby, Netlify CMS and Cloudinary 
</h1>

This is for my virtual howrses at www.howrse.com (jennego on international) but could be easily adapted to other hobby collections for things like model horses or....whatever non horse thing one would collect.

This site uses

- Gatsby with GraphQL
- Netlify CMS
- Netlify for hosting
- Cloudinary for image uploads

It has provisions for tagging but I'm not dealing with that yet.
